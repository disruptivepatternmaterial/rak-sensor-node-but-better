/*
 * Feature switches — bring one subsystem up at a time.
 *
 * Every feature defaults ON here. platformio.ini defines cut-down environments that turn
 * subsets OFF, so a failure can be isolated to one subsystem without editing code:
 *
 *   pio run -e stage1    wind sensor only, printed over USB
 *   pio run -e stage2    + battery
 *   pio run -e stage3    + radio (still awake, still printing)
 *   pio run -e rak4631   everything, including sleep — the field image
 *
 * Sleep is the last thing switched on deliberately: a sleeping board with no USB console
 * is the hardest state to debug, so nothing else should still be in question by then.
